"""Jam tools: run a Jam of Knowledge Agents (and people) and read the results.

A Jam asks its participants to respond to prompts, then to review each other's responses.
These tools run a Jam the way the current app does: the Jam Builder's plan creates a
draft, and launch opens it. Knowledge Agents then take part in the background, and people
take part in the app. These tools act as the owner of the API key, and only a Jam's
creator can launch it or add agents.
